# ðŸ§© A Sudoku App (WIP)
I recently implemented a function to [solve a sudoku game](https://github.com/jasonflorentino/algorithms-dataStructures/tree/main/sudoku). Figured I'd combine that with the next couple things I've been wanting to try: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

Not really sure where this is going yet, it's kind of just for learning/fun.

### Tasks:
ðŸ’­ Change number from the Control pane  
ðŸ’­ Click button to auto solve puzzle  
âœ… Can't lock an empty number box  
âœ… Different colors for different box states: Focus, Empty, Locked, Highlighted  
âœ… Lock and Unlock a box from being changed  
âœ… Add control pane for other actions on a selected box  
âœ… UI feedback for if board is solved or not  
âœ… Dark mode  
âœ… Add Typescript  
âœ… Able to change each number in the grid  
âœ… Display the board on a grid  

### Details
- Bootstrapped with CRA
- Added Tailwind and Recoil first
- Converted to TypeScript after
- Seems to be some dependency issues that popped up during TypeScript migration, but it worked after installing deps with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.
