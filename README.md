# A Sudoku App (WIP)
I recently implemented a function to [solve a sudoku game](https://github.com/jasonflorentino/algorithms-dataStructures/tree/main/sudoku). Figured I'd combine that with the next couple things I've been wanting to try: [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

Not really sure where this is going yet, it's kind of just for learning/fun.

### Tasks:
ðŸ’­ Change number from the Control pane  
âœ… Lock and Unlock a box from being changed  
âœ… Add control pane for other actions on a selected box  
âœ… UI feedback for if board is solved or not  
âœ… Dark mode  
âœ… Able to change each number in the grid  
âœ… Display the board on a grid
